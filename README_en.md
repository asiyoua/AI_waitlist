AI technology is thriving, with major companies releasing products one after another. Individuals are busy scrambling to join waitlists, so I have collected various waitlists for AI programs and services in both domestic and international markets, making it convenient for everyone to queue up.
Apart from providing the waitlist links, I have included additional information and indicated any issues related to accessibility in certain regions.
The entries listed prior to May 15th have been consolidated. From now on, the closer an entry is to the top, the more recent the waitlist information.
